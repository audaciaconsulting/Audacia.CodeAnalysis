# Audacia.CodeAnalysis.AspNetCore

The [CodeAnalysis.AspNetCore.ruleset](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/AspNetCoreAnalyzers) provides extra configuration for ASP.NET Core analyzers, and disables certain other rules where controller actions do not align with the rule, for example adding an `Async` suffix to all `async` methods. This ruleset is applicable to ASP.NET Core Web API projects.

See the [Audacia.CodeAnalysis](https://github.com/audaciaconsulting/Audacia.CodeAnalysis/blob/master/README.md) project for full information about how to use the code analysis library.
